## 🆚 ROS1 vs ROS2 — Key Differences

| Feature           | ROS1                                      | ROS2                                                  |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| **🧠 Middleware**     | Uses **TCPROS**, which is not flexible and does **not support real-time** operations or **QoS** (Quality of Service). | Uses **DDS (Data Distribution Service)**, which **supports RTOS**, real-time operations, and **QoS policies**. |
| **🔗 Communication** | Relies on a **central master node** to manage communication. If the master fails, the whole system can halt. | Uses **peer-to-peer communication**; no central master. Nodes can directly discover, publish, and subscribe to each other. |
| **📈 Scalability**   | Poor scalability. Requires **firewall rules for each device**, and large systems cause **latency on the master node**. | Much better scalability via **discovery servers**. Only discovery servers need firewall access; communication is **faster and more efficient**. |
| **🚀 Launch System** | Uses **XML-based** `.launch` files.                          | Uses **Python-based** `.py` launch files (more flexible and scriptable). |
| **🏗️ Build System**   | Uses **catkin**, which combines CMake and Python tools.     | Uses **colcon** and **pure CMake**, improving modularity and build performance. |
| **🧪 Python Version** | Uses **Python 2.7**, which is now outdated.                  | Uses **Python 3**, which is modern and actively maintained. |

### 📝 Summary

ROS2 brings **modern architecture**, **better performance**, and **support for real-time systems**. It's built with distributed robotics, reliability, and scalability in mind, making it more suitable for **production-grade** applications.
